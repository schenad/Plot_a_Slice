# Plot_a_Slice
A handy tool to plot one slice of 4-dimentional data (3-D parameter space+intensity at the spot), written in Matlab
## Convention in .txt File
- It reads all the *.txt files in the same folder, saves a *.png image for each *.txt with the same file name
- It automatically skips the headers and directly reads the matrix in the *.txt file
- The first column is the energy in eV; the rest is a vertical slice in the 3-D parameter space
